ENS is forward compatible with DNS. What this means is that the current DNS model can be extended forward into the blockchain by bridging DNS domains into the ENS protocol. Importing a DNS domain to be used within the blockchain via the ENS protocol does not transfer the registration or ownership of the domain. 

# Extending DNS with ENS

ENS-enabling a DNS domain will extend the functionality the DNS domain has, opening up to it the world of blockchain and web3. The DNS domain's website will continue to resolve in browsers since that part . Email will continue to function on traditional web servers and your DNS records will still resolve and be updated as normal through your DNS provider or Registrar (where you purchased your .com domain for example).

Once the blockchain knows about your DNS domain that was imported into ENS, you can immediately receive Ethereum tokens to the blockchain wallet that has the private keys (ie. access) to control your imported DNS domainâ€™s records on the blockchain. In this way, the functionality of your DNS name has been extended to the blockchain. The DNS records are still intact, but now you are able to assign blockchain records.
